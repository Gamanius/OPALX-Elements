MC4 ReadMe
----------
Assume you are checking out IPPL in $HOME/svnwork/ippl


Build the Initializer
---------------------
The Initializer is in the IPPL projects directory.
Before building the Initializer and later installing mc4, 
make sure you have he following environment variables set:

export IPPL_ROOT=$HOME/svnwork/ippl
export IPPL_PREFIX=$HOME/build/ippl
export INITIALIZER_LIB_DIR=$IPPL_ROOT/projects/initializer/build

mkdir -p $INITIALIZER_LIB_DIR; cd $INITIALIZER_LIB_DIR

rm -rf CMakeCache.txt; CXX=mpicxx cmake ~/svnwork/ippl/projects/initalizer


Build MC4
---------
export H5hut=$HOME/extlib/H5hut-1.99.7

The go to the mc4 project directory:

cd $IPPL_ROOT/procect/mc4-new
mkdir build; cd build
rm -rf CMakeCache.txt; CXX=mpicxx cmake $IPPL_ROOT/projects/mc4-new/

export MC4_EXE_PATH=$IPPL_ROOT/projects/mc4-new/build/src

Note, that mpicxx (and later mpirun) is perfectly valid for MACOS-X and 
Linux but maybe different on Cray, IBM and other HPC systems.


MC2-MC4 Tests
-------------

test-1
======
Read initial conditions from fort.66 generated by mc2 and runs
a suimulation from redshift 50 to 0. Run gnuplot with test-1.gpl to
check the P(k) for mc4 and mc2.

cd $IPPL_ROOT/projects/mc4-new/regressionTests/test-1
mpirun -np 8 $MC4_EXE_PATH/mc4 init-1 fort.66 --info 0 | tee test.out
gnuplot init-1.gpl
