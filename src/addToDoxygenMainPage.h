OPALX is a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear
accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. Using the MAD language
with extensions, OPALX can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high
performance computing systems. OPALX is built from the ground up as a
parallel application, is perormance portable and exascale ready. 

The OPALX framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new
C++Â classes.
