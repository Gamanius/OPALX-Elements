        * - **Scratch Memory**: Scratch memory is allocated per team for a local histogram, with size `binCount`.
        * - **Concurrency**: `team_size` specifies the number of threads per team, and each team processes a `block_size`.
        *
        * @note This function is optimized for GPU execution using team-based parallelism,
        *       it does not work on Host (since `team_size` is hardcoded and to a big number). 
        *       If you want to run this on Host, change `team_size=1` and increase `block_size`.
        *
        * @pre `localBinHisto` and `binIndex` must be initialized with appropriate sizes before calling this function.
        * 
        * @post `localBinHisto` contains the reduced histogram for the local data.

        /**
        * @brief Applies a Lorentz transformation to a given vector field based on particle velocities.
        * 
        * @tparam T The data type of the field components (e.g., `double`, `float`).
        * @tparam Dim The dimensionality of the field.
        * @param field A reference to the vector field to be transformed.
        * @return A reference to the transformed field.
        * 
        * @details
        * - **Gamma Factor Calculation:** The gamma factor is derived from the velocity components of particles.
        *   For a given particle velocity \(v\), the gamma factor is computed as:
        *   \[
        *   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}}}
        *   \]
        *   where \(\vec{v}\) is the velocity vector of a particle.
        * 
        * - **Field Transformation:** After computing the gamma factor, each component of the field is
        *   multiplied by the corresponding gamma factor.
        * 
        * ### Example Usage:
        * ```cpp
        * VField_t<double, 3> field = ...; // Initialize the field
        * this->bins_m->LTrans(field);     // Apply Lorentz transformation
        * ```
        * 
        * @note This function should not be used inside OPAL-X, since it makes assumptions regarding the actual
        *       particle bunch. It is just for testing during development.
