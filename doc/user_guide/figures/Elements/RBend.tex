  \caption{Illustration of a general rectangular bend (\keyword{RBEND}) with a positive bend angle $\alpha$. The
    entrance edge angle, $E_{1}$, is positive in this example. An \keyword{RBEND} has parallel entrance and exit
    pole faces, so the exit angle, $E_{2}$, is uniquely determined by the bend angle, $\alpha$, and $E_{1}$
    ($E_{2}=\alpha - E_{1}$). For a positively charge particle, the magnetic field is directed out of the page.}
