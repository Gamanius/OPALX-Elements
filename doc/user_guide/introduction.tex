\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:Introduction}

\section{Aim of \opal and History}
\opal is a tool for charged-particle optics in
accelerator structures and beam lines.
Using the \mad language with extensions, \opal is derived from \madninep and is based
on the \classic \cite{bib:classic} class library, which was started in 1995 by an international
collaboration.  IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) is
the framework which provides parallel particles and fields using data parallel approach.
\opal is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that HPC (High Performance Computing)
is the third leg of science, complementing theory and the experiment.
HPC is made possible now through the increasingly sophisticated mathematical models and evolving computer power available on the desktop
and in super computer centers. \opal runs on your laptop as well as on the largest HPC clusters available today.

The \opal framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new
\texttt{C++}~classes.

\opal comes in the following flavors:
\begin{itemize}
\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowMap}}{
\item \opalmap
}{}
\item \opalcycl
\item \opalt
\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowEnv}}{
\item \opalenv
}{}
\end{itemize}

\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowMap}}{
\opalmap tracks particles with 3D space charge using split operator techniques, and is a proper subset of \madninep. In the future
a linear space charge mode will become available
allowing the user to track moments of the distribution.
}{}

\opalcycl tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighboring turns in cyclotrons
with time as the independent variable.

\opalt is a super-set of \impactt \cite{qiang2005} and can be used to model guns, injectors, ERLs and complete XFELs excluding the undulator.

\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowMap}}{
It should be noted that not all features of \opal are available in all flavors.\\ The following icon \noopalt means that a feature is not yet
available in \opalt. Similar icons are used for the other flavors.

It should be noted that not all features of \opal are available in both flavors.\\ The following icon \noopalt means that a feature is not yet
available in \opalt. A similar icon is used for \opalcycl.

\section{Parallel Processing Capabilities}
\opal is built to harness the power of parallel processing for an improved quantitative understanding
of particle accelerators.
This goal can only be achieved with
detailed 3D modelling capabilities and a sufficient number of simulation particles to obtain meaningful statistics on various
quantities of the particle ensemble such as emittance, slice emittance, halo extension etc.

The following example is exemplifying this fact:

\end{tabular*}

\figref{walldrift} shows the parallel efficiency time as a function of used cores for a test example with parameters given in \tabref{pex1}.  The data where obtained on a Cray XT5 at the Swiss Center for Scientific Computing.

\section{Quality Management}
Documentation and quality assurance are given our highest attention since we are convinced that adequate documentation
is a key factor in the usefulness of a code like \opal to study present and future particle accelerators.
 Using tools such as a source code version
control system (\href{https://git-scm.com}{git}), source code documentation using Doxygen (found \href{http://amas.web.psi.ch/docs/opal/html/}{here}) and the extensive user manual you are now enjoying, we are committed to providing users as well as co-developers with
state-of-the-art documentation to \opal.

One example of an non trivial test-example is the PSI DC GUN. In \figref{guncomp1} the comparison between \impactt and \opalt is shown. This example is part of the regression test suite
that is run every night. The input file is found in \secref{examplesbeamlines}.

Misprints and obscurity are almost inevitable in a document of this size.
Comments and {\em active contributions}  from readers are therefore most welcome.
They may be sent to \htmladdnormallink{\texttt{andreas.adelmann@psi.ch}}{mailto:andreas.adelmann@psi.ch}.

\section{Output}
The phase space is stored in the H5hut file-format \cite{bib:howison2010} and can be analyzed
using e.g. H5root \cite{bib:schietinger}. The frequency
of the data output (phase space and some statistical quantities) can be controlled using the \keyword[sec:option]{OPTION} statement \seesec{option},
 with the flag \keyword{PSDUMPFREQ}. The file is named like in input file but with the extension {\tt .h5}.

A SDDS compatible ASCII file with statistical beam parameters is written to a file with extension {\tt .stat}. The frequency with which this data is written can be controlled with the \keyword[sec:option]{OPTION} statement \seesec{option} with the flag \keyword{STATDUMPFREQ}.

\section{Known Issues and Limitations}
\subsection{\opalcycl}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Restart with the option \keyword{PSDUMPLOCALFRAME} does not work yet,
    \item In complicated geometries such as spiral inflectors, proper particle deletion at the boundary sometimes fails.
\end{itemize}
