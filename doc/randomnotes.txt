A note on documentation etc. for collegues starting work on OPAL:

1) The full documentation gor OPAL 2.x.x is on the Wiki: https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/wikis/Manual/home 

2) Also the C++ source code must be documented please read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen and document
   your source code accordingly.

3) We have to do some artwork for our paper(s) and documentation. Please use only TikZ and see the power of
   this package (and many examples to start) at http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/ .
