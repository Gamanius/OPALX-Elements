<p>Most computer bookstores have several shelves full of introductory
books on C++.  <a href="#bib-c++-for-fortran"><cite>C++ for Fortran
Programmers</cite></a>, by Ira Pohl, is among the better of these.
The book is well organized, and covers all of the language's most
useful features without becoming bogged down in details.

<p>After working through one of those, everyone who plans to use the
language should read <a href="#bib-effective-c++"><cite>Effective
C++</cite></a> by Scott Meyers, and <a
href="#bib-data-structures-c++"><cite>Algorithms, Data Structures, and
Problem Solving with C++</cite></a> by Mark Weiss.  <a
href="#bib-effective-c++"><cite>Effective C++</cite></a> (and its
companion, <a href="#bib-more-effective-c++"><cite>More Effective
C++</cite></a>) present dozens of guidelines on how to use C++
effectively.  Always making destructors virtual, for example, makes it
safer and easier to create heterogeneous collections of objects, while
explicitly providing a copy constructor can prevent many hard-to-find
aliasing bugs.

<p>Weiss's book on data structures is a conventional textbook, but
better written and more up-to-date than most.  The author covers basic
structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues before moving on to
trees, hash tables, skip lists, and their more complicated kin.  His
presentation and analysis are concise and to-the-point, and the book
provides complete implementations of all of the data structures it
describes.

<p>Almost all programming books talk about design; John Lakos's <a
href="#bib-large-scale-c++"><cite>Large-Scale C++ Software
Design</cite></a> is one of the few devoted to the problems that arise
in actually implementing large programs.  The book discusses ways to
(re-)organize source code to reduce compilation time (from several
days to overnight in one case), ease maintenance, and facilitate
re-use.

<p>Finally, Musser and Saini's <a href="#bib-stl"><cite>STL Tutorial
and Reference Guide</cite></a> is exactly what its title implies.  The
first part of the book explains what the C++ Standard Template Library
(STL) is trying to accomplish; the middle introduces the STL's major
features, and shows how they are used, while the back of the book is a
reference guide.
